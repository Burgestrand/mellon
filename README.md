# Mellon

> Speak, Friend, and enter.

Mellon is four things:

- A simple library for reading and writing notes in Mac OSX keychains. (see [Mellon::Keychain][])
- A simple library for using Mac OSX keychain notes as hash storage. (see [Mellon::Store][])
- An adapter for [econfig](https://github.com/elabs/econfig), that uses [Mellon::Store][].
- A tiny CLI interface for [Mellon::Keychain][]. (see [Command-line interface](#command-line-interface))

I built Mellon because I wanted Yet Another Way of Managing Application Secretsâ„¢.

Mellon is sponsored by [Elabs][].

## Usage

### Using with Econfig (recommended)

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "mellon", require: "mellon/econfig"
```

And create an initializer `config/initializers/econfig.rb`:

```ruby
if Rails.env.development?
  Econfig.instance.backends << Econfig::Mellon.new(Rails.application.name)
end
```

# Documentation

## Mellon::Keychain

Mellon::Keychain allows you to read and write notes in OSX keychains.

```ruby
keychain = Mellon::Keychain.default
keychain["ruby note"] # => nil
keychain["ruby note"] = "Hello from Ruby!" # creates keychain note `ruby note`
keychain["ruby note"] # => "Hello from Ruby!"
keychain["ruby note"] = nil # deletes keychain note `ruby note`
```

## Mellon::Store

Mellon::Store is a layer above Mellon::Keychain, allowing you to use a single keychain note as hash storage. Notes are serialized as YAML by default.

```ruby
project_name = "ruby note"
store = Mellon::Store.new(project_name, keychain: Mellon::Keychain.default)
store["some key"] # => nil
store["some key"] = "Hello from Ruby!" # creates keychain note "ruby note", and puts value for "some key" in it
store["some key"] # => "Hello from Ruby!"

# Have a peek at the data, which is serialized as YAML
store.keychain[store.project_name] # => "---\nsome key: Hello from Ruby!\n"
```

## Command-line interface

When you install the Mellon gem you also get an executable called `mellon`. See `mellon -h` for usage information.
